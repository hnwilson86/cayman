My name is Holly Nicole Wilson. I was born and raised in Moab. Growing up in Moab was one of the best experiences anyone could ever imagine. My childhood was filled with lots of joyful moments and fun camping trips. My parents took us camping every weekend during the season. We never sat home unless it was snowing. We would explore the Book Cliffs on our mules for weeks at a time or enjoy the heat of the desert called Beef Basin looking for arrowheads, and Indain ruins. I feel, if I had grown up in the city my life would be different than the life I was given to enjoy. Of course coming from a small town comes with its challenges. Those challenges I would never trade it in for the world.
